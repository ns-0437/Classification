Random Forest Classifier Example with Streamlit

This Streamlit app demonstrates the use of a Random Forest Classifier for classification tasks. The app includes the following features:

Displaying Data:

The app loads both the training and testing datasets from Excel files.
Users can view the contents of the training and testing datasets to understand the structure and format of the data.
Model Training:

The training dataset is split into features (X) and the target variable (y).
Data preprocessing techniques, such as scaling using StandardScaler, are applied to the features.
A Random Forest Classifier model is trained on the preprocessed training data.
Model Evaluation:

The accuracy of the trained model is evaluated using the training dataset.
The accuracy score is displayed to assess the performance of the model on the training data.
Predictions:

The trained model is then used to predict the target values for the testing dataset.
Predicted target values are appended to the testing dataset for further analysis.
Predictions are saved to a CSV file named 'predicted_test.csv' for future reference.
Instructions for Use:
Installation:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using pip:
Copy code
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn
Running the App:

Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the app files.
Run the Streamlit app using the following command:
arduino
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Interacting with the App:

Upon running the app, you'll see an interactive interface with sections for displaying data, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
Use the displayed dataframes to examine the contents of the training and testing datasets.
Analyze the model accuracy to assess its performance on the training data.
View the predictions generated by the model on the testing dataset.
Saving Predictions:

Predictions made by the model are saved to a CSV file named 'predicted_test.csv' in the same directory as the app.
You can access the CSV file to view the predicted target values for the testing dataset.





KMeans Clustering Visualization:

This Streamlit app performs KMeans clustering on a given dataset and visualizes the results using an interactive interface. The app includes the following features:

Elbow Method Plot:

The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters for KMeans clustering.
The within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) is calculated for different numbers of clusters (k) and plotted against the number of clusters.
Users can visualize the Elbow Method plot to identify the optimal number of clusters based on the "elbow point" where the rate of decrease in WCSS slows down.
Clustering Results Visualization:

After determining the optimal number of clusters, KMeans clustering is performed on the dataset with the chosen number of clusters.
The resulting clusters are visualized using a scatter plot where each data point is colored according to its assigned cluster.
Users can explore the clustering results to identify patterns and groupings within the data.
Predicting Cluster for New Data:

A function is provided to predict the cluster for new data points based on the trained KMeans model.
Users can input new data points and obtain the predicted cluster for each data point.
Instructions for Use:

Interacting with the App:

Upon running the app, you'll see an interactive interface with different sections:
The Elbow Method plot helps determine the optimal number of clusters.
The Clustering Results section visualizes the clusters obtained from KMeans clustering.
Use the provided input field to enter new data points and predict their clusters.
Exploring Results:

Analyze the Elbow Method plot to choose the appropriate number of clusters.
Explore the clustering results to understand the patterns and groupings within the dataset.
Use the prediction feature to classify new data points into the existing clusters.
